Note: Halfway Across is a proof-of-concept that I developed primarily to familiarize myself with basic Qt and OOP concepts. Any further development on it will be fairly sporadic.

**Content Warning: Depicts mental illness and late 19th century hunting practices**

Halfway Across is a parser-based interactive fiction game that follows a man named Edmond attempting to adapt to life as a mountain man. How Edmond chooses to interact with the travelers that cross his path can have a profound impact on his quality of life in the mountains, with some having the potential to be useful allies and others posing a threat.

## Gameplay Mechanics
- **Crafting:** Use resources to make items that can aid in your survival.
- **Hunting:** Obtain raw food and other resources by hunting animals in the valley. 
- **Ice Fishing:** Obtain raw food by catching fish at the lake. 
- **Resource Management:** Weigh the costs and benefits of keeping an item on your person during your travels.
- **Social Interaction:** Converse and trade with travelers, knowing that your dialogue choices will impact how they perceive you.
